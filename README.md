## Assignment:
Help the Magazine Filter improve sales. Sort of.

## Project structure
This projects backend was built using the WordPress stack WordPlate https://wordplate.github.io/docs/introduction that simplifies the otherwise rather messy process of setting up and working with a WordPress project.
The frontend part is built using React (create-react-app).

## Creators:
- Christopher Mattsson (Development)
- Daniel Jägerskog (Design)
- Sarah Nyman (Design)
- Ricardo Löfvenholm (UX-Design)
- Amalia Ekman (UX-Design)
